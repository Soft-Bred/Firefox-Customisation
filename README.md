# Firefox-Customisation

Basic things I take from r/firefoxcss to make Firefox look better.
(keep in mind that i have absolutley no clue how most of these work and just follow tutorials given my people much smarter than me)

## Javascript Stuff

### [Fluent Reveal Effect On Toolbar Buttons & Tabs](https://www.reddit.com/r/FirefoxCSS/comments/njcsi1/fluent_reveal_effect_on_toolbar_buttons/)

**Installation:**
- Basically follow [this](https://github.com/MrOtherGuy/fx-autoconfig "this") and dont fuck it up.
*Note that when talking about the Chrome folder in the [Profile folder](https://github.com/MrOtherGuy/fx-autoconfig#setting-up-profile "Profile folder")	, the "JS", "utils" and "resourses" folders will be automatically created.*

- Install [fluentRevealTabs.uc.js](https://github.com/aminomancer/uc.css.js/blob/master/script/fluentRevealTabs.uc.js "fluentRevealTabs.uc.js") & [fluentRevealNavbar.uc.js](https://github.com/aminomancer/uc.css.js/blob/master/script/fluentRevealNavbar.uc.js "fluentRevealNavbar.uc.js") and put them into the newly created JS folder inside your profile folder.

## CSS Snippets
Create a folder in your chrome folder called "CSS Snippets", this is where all of your different additions will go to keep them organised and named.
