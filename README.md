# Firefox-Customisation

Basic things I take from r/firefoxcss to make Firefox look better.
(keep in mind that i have absolutley no clue how most of these work and just follow tutorials given my people much smarter than me)

------------
## Firefox Extentions
- List of extetions I use can be found [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/collections/16734717/Extentions/ "here")
## Javascript Stuff

### [Fluent Reveal Effect On Toolbar Buttons & Tabs](https://www.reddit.com/r/FirefoxCSS/comments/njcsi1/fluent_reveal_effect_on_toolbar_buttons/)

**Installation:**
- Basically follow [this](https://github.com/MrOtherGuy/fx-autoconfig "this") and dont fuck it up.
*Note that when talking about the Chrome folder in the [Profile folder](https://github.com/MrOtherGuy/fx-autoconfig#setting-up-profile "Profile folder")	, the "JS", "utils" and "resourses" folders will be automatically created.*

- Install [fluentRevealTabs.uc.js](https://github.com/aminomancer/uc.css.js/blob/master/script/fluentRevealTabs.uc.js "fluentRevealTabs.uc.js") & [fluentRevealNavbar.uc.js](https://github.com/aminomancer/uc.css.js/blob/master/script/fluentRevealNavbar.uc.js "fluentRevealNavbar.uc.js") and put them into the newly created JS folder inside your profile folder.

## CSS Snippets
The CSS Snippets folder is made with the idea of organisation, so as to be able to edit individual aspects of code without having to interfere with any others.
